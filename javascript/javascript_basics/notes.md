### Working with Strings and Finding Help

One can find resources for JS at MDN (Mozilla Developer Network)

Strings are objects with properties - for example 'length'

```javascript

//object property notation
message.length

// 'message' is the object
// 'length' is the property

```

#### Notes about objects

* A string, the document, the browser's console
* Objects have properties, such as the length of a string
* Objects have methods, which are actions the objects can perform

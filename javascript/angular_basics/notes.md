## MVC Frameworks and AngularJS

### Elements of Angular

* Directives
* Factories
* Controllers
* Filters

**Directive** - The fundamental building block of Angular. They serve as the definitions for various declarations you want to use within your Angular application.

**Factories** - Used to maintain one single instance of something. They are often used for maintaining state. Additionally, they can be used to provide an abstraction layer between your directives and your APIs.

**Controllers** - Have a lot of similar functionality to directives, but they are predominantly used just for data connections and logical restraints around them. Unlike a directive, they can't contain any extra templating or complex ordering.

**Filters** - Used to implement temporary transformations of data as it travels between the model and the view.
